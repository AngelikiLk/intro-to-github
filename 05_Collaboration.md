## Community Profile

GitHub has created a Community Profile checklist to help make sure your project meets the recommended community standards to help people use and contribute to your project. You can read more [About community profiles for public repositories](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories), [Starting an Open Source Project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) and [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/).

You can find the Community Profile checklist via the `Insights` tab and then select `Community` in the left sidebar. It checks to see if a project includes recommended community health files, such as
- [ ] Description
- [ ] README
- [ ] Code of Conduct
- [ ] Contributing guidelines
- [ ] License
- [ ] Issue templates
- [ ] Pull Request templates

I have listed resources below to help you get started on these files:
- **Description**: Add an optional short description about the repository which will be displayed in the right sidebar of the `Code` tab.
- **README**: A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you share expectations and manage contributions to your project.
