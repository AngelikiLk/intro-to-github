# Tutorial to set up a GitHub repository/project

Outline:
   - Hello World tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
   - Contribute to @OpenDataManchester's Pick N Mix repository: https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources
   - Create a personal website using GitHub Pages tutorial: https://guides.github.com/features/pages/


## Hello World

In this session, we will be working through the [GitHub Guides Hello Wolrd](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial. The guide teaches you how to 
- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open and merge a pull request



## Contributing to another user's repository

I will next demonstrate how to **fork** someone else's repository, make changes, and contribute them back to the original project with a **pull request**. 

1. Go to Open Data Manchester's [training-and-resources](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources) repository.
2. Open the [Pick-N-Mix](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/tree/master/Pick-N-Mix) folder and explore the contents to learn more about the repository and see where you can contribute. Based on the existing structure, I should be able to add a sub-directory for the resources to my Intro to GitHub Pick N Mix session.
3. Click on the `Add file` button and select `Create new file`.
